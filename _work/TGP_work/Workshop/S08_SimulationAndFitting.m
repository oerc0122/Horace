% imperative if the dispersion varies significantly in a direction
% perpendicular to your cut/slice, as it introduces broadening that the dnd
% simulation fails to capture.

% to use the new function which the commands below assumes will be in the
% file Fe_FM_spinwaves.m
%

% includes the Fe form factor in the file Fe_FM_spinwaves_FF.m

% also has to be fixed. Also, the background gradient is not well-defined,
